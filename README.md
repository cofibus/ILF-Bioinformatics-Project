response.txt and GPCRdb_peptide_ligands.csv are both the GPCRdb data of all GPCR ligands, sequences and PDB ID and Chain we obtained from here. 
The rest of the data and scripts used for each search are in their respective directories. 
foldseek_Search is missing the resulting parsed .csv from the search results as well as the annotated one. The folder with all foldseek results (.m8 files for each query and database) is also missing. 
These files are two big to upload from the webserver.
